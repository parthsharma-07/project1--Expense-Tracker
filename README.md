# project1- Expense Tracker
Internship Project1


Simple Expense Tracker Project
This is a simple but functional Expense Tracker I built to practice my fundamental web development skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal was to create a clean, easy-to-use tool for logging income and expenses.
This project was built from a 3files HTML ,CSS and JS, which contains all the necessary structure, styling, and logic.

What It Does
This application allows you to:
Add Transactions: You can add a description and an amount for any transaction. Use a positive number for income and a negative number for an expense.
See Your Balance: The app automatically calculates and displays your total balance based on your transactions.
View Income & Expense Summary: See a clear breakdown of your total income and total expenses.
Transaction History: Your entire transaction history is listed, with income in green and expenses in red.
Delete Transactions: If you make a mistake, you can easily delete any transaction by hovering over it and clicking the 'x' button.

How to Run It:

Since this is a simple front-end project, you don't need any special tools to run it.
Make sure you have the expense-tracker.html file on your computer.
Simply double-click the file, and it will open directly in your web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari). That's it!
How The Code Works
The project is built with three core web technologies, all within one file:
HTML: Provides the basic structure of the page, including the input form, the summary boxes, and the list where transactions appear.
CSS: All the styling is located  in the CSS file. It handles the layout, colors, and fonts to make the application look clean and user-friendly.
JavaScript: This is the brain of the application. The JavaScript code  is in JS file responsible for:
Listening for when you submit the form to add a new transaction.
Storing all the transactions in an array.
Calculating the balance, income, and expense totals.
Dynamically updating the page to show new and deleted transactions.
What I Learned from This Project
Building this expense tracker was a great learning experience. I got hands-on practice with:
DOM Manipulation: Using JavaScript to add and remove elements from the HTML page was a key part of this project.
Handling User Events: I learned how to capture user input from a form and make the application react when a button is clicked.
Working with Arrays and Loops: The core logic involves storing data in an array and looping through it to perform calculations and display the results.
Connecting Logic to the UI: This project really helped me understand how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together to create a complete, interactive application.
